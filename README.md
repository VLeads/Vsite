# some details

Here, I'm just trying to understand git and gihub.
Like how commit and push works.
Good practices to write commit messages
Also just going to create a portfolio representing info about me and mine projects :)

For now, I know:

1. NodeJS
1. repl.it
1. CHALK
1. HTML
1. CSS

# Also good commit msgs are:-

feat - a new feature
fix - a bug fix
docs - changes in documentation
style - everything related to styling
refactor - code changes that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
test - everything related to testing
chore - updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc

## example: suppose we added test for function which checks leap year -->(we will write "test" then in short describe what we did)

test: add unit test for leapYearCheck( )
